Dev team:
Starting from an exisiting code base.
Mr Kinser suggests divide and conqeour. Identify problems and divy up into solvable tasks.
First sprint can be getting the current code base to build on our IDE.

Look for documentation if the previous team defined coding standards, potentially change them as a team.
The previous team should have used client server and C#.
Figure out the previous teams project stack.
Did they define their definition of done? If so what was it? Is it suffecient for us?
Find any UML that was used and decide if we will use it.

How will we track our backlog? (Sticky notes, notion.o, google.dox)
How will we source control? Probably github, go figure.
